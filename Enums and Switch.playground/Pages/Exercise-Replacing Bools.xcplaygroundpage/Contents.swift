## Exercise: Replacing Bools
 
 The following struct describes a type of enemy in a game:

/*:
 As your game has developed, youâ€™ve decided that your enemies might have more than one type of weapon.

 - callout(Exercise): Define an enum to represent the weapons an enemy might have: `none`, `sword`, `rubberMallet` and so on. Change the struct definition to use your new enum instead of a `Bool`.
